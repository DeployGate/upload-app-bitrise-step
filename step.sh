# Envman can handle piped inputs, which is useful if the text you want to
# share is complex and you don't want to deal with proper bash escaping:
#  cat file_with_complex_input | envman add --KEY EXAMPLE_STEP_OUTPUT
# You can find more usage examples on envman's GitHub page
#  at: https://github.com/bitrise-io/envman

#
# --- Exit codes:
# The exit code of your Step is very important. If you return
#  with a 0 exit code `bitrise` will register your Step as "successful".
# Any non zero exit code will be registered as "failed" by `bitrise`.
